<h1>XTIFFOpen - Open GeoTIFF File</h1>

<b>
<pre>
    #include &lt;xtiffio.h&gt;
    TIFF* XTIFFOpen( const char * name, const char * mode );
</pre>
</b>

This function is used to open GeoTIFF files instead of TIFFOpen() from
libtiff.  Internally it calls TIFFOpen(), but sets up some extra hooks
so that GeoTIFF tags can be extracted from the file.  If XTIFFOpen() isn't
used, <a href="GTIFNew.html">GTIFNew()</a> won't work properly.  Files opened
with XTIFFOpen() should be closed with 
<a href="XTIFFClose.html">XTIFFClose()</a>.<p>

The name of the file to be opened should be passed as <b>name</b>, and an
opening mode ("r", "w" or "a") acceptable to TIFFOpen() should be passed as the
<b>mode</b>.<p>

If XTIFFOpen() fails it will return NULL.  Otherwise, normal TIFFOpen()
error reporting steps will have already taken place.<p>
