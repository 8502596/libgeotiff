<H3><A NAME="What is TIFF format?">What is TIFF format?</A></H3>
TIFF format is the most popular and versatile raster data format in the world today. 
TIFF is a format for storage, transfer, display, and printing
of raster images, such as clipart, logotypes, scanned documents. 
Today, TIFF is being used for storage of map information, too.<p>

More information on TIFF can be found at Niles Ritter's 
<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~ritter/tiff/">Unofficial TIFF
Page</a>. <p>

<H3><A NAME="What is the purpose of GeoTIFF format for satellite data?">What is the purpose of GeoTIFF format for satellite data?</A></H3>
     
The TIFF imagery file format can be used to store and transfer 
digital satellite imagery, scanned aerial photos, elevation 
models, scanned maps or the results of many types of geographic 
analysis.   Over the past several years many users of such images have 
urged geographic data suppliers to provide imagery in TIFF format. 
TIFF is the only full-featured format in the public domain, 
capable of supporting compression, tiling, and extension to include 
geographic metadata.  GeoTIFF implements the geographic metadata
formally, using compliant TIFF tags and structures.  

<H3><A NAME="What is GeoTIFF and how is this different from TIFF?">What is GeoTIFF and how is this different from TIFF?</A></H3>
     
"GeoTIFF" refers to TIFF files which have geographic (or 
cartographic) data embedded as tags within the TIFF file.  
The geographic data can then be used to position the image 
in the correct location and geometry on the screen of a 
geographic information display.  
     <P>
GeoTIFF is a metadata format, which provides geographic 
information to associate with the image data.  But the TIFF 
file structure allows both the metadata and the image 
data to be encoded into the same file.  
<P>
GeoTIFF makes use of a public tag structure which is platform interoperable between 
any and all GeoTIFF-savvy readers.  Any GIS, CAD, Image Processing, Desktop Mapping 
and any other types of systems using geographic images can read any GeoTIFF files 
created on any system to the GeoTIFF specification. 

<H3><A NAME="Who owns GeoTIFF Format?">Who owns GeoTIFF Format?</A></H3>

The GeoTIFF format is completely open, public domain, non-proprietary.  It 
was produced by Dr. Niles Ritter, while at NASA-JPL (Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory), and 
changes, or additions to the format are proposed through a public review using
email and WWW resources.  Two meetings of developers from all areas of the 
geographic information processing industry have lead to proposals for revision,
since early 1994.  
<P></P>
There is no restriction on licensing, implementation, promulgation, or any
uses of the format.  The format is entirely open, and available to all.  
The specifications are public, there are abundant free software source libraries,
toolkits, data samples, and technical support through the email forum. 
<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="Can IP, GIS, CAD, and Desktop Mapping systems all use GeoTIFF?">Can IP, GIS, CAD, and Desktop Mapping systems all use GeoTIFF?</A></H3>

The format is available to any software company, for free with no restrictions on license.  
It is the decision of the product managers for each software to include GeoTIFF capability in 
the geographic data management products which they sell. 
<P>
Many systems today can read GeoTIFF files into correct geographic position in a variety 
of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Image Processors (IP) and Computer Aided Design (CAD)
softwares.  You need to check with your system provider to find out if they have written the
software module to read/write GeoTIFF imagery in the software version which you use.      
 
<H3><A NAME="What softwares can read and georeference GeoTIFF today?">What softwares can read and georeference GeoTIFF today?</A></H3>
     
There are many GIS software companies who have released versions of their softwares that read
and write GeoTIFF.  Others have scheduled their support 
for GeoTIFF in their current or near-future product updates.  
<P>On the <A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~ritter/geotiff/geotiff.html">GeoTIFF WWW Homepage</A>
you can see statements from Mapinfo, ESRI, Softdesk, Intergraph, ERDAS, Innovativ Vision, 
TNTMips, DataDoors, Laser-Scan, Able Software, ER Mapper, PCI, and BBN.  
<P>
There are many other softwares which have not sent their release information to the 
Further information on industry support is in the 
<A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~ritter/geotiff/software.html"> 
GeoTIFF Software Table</A>     
<P>     

<H3><A NAME="What Data providers are delivering geographic images in GeoTIFF format today?">What Data providers are delivering geographic images in GeoTIFF format today?</A></H3>

Data providers who have stated their intentions to deliver imagery in the GeoTIFF 
format include 
   <UL>
   <LI>SPOT Image Corp
   <LI>Trifid (representing LandSat data)
   <LI>Space Imaging
   <LI>US Geological Survey
   <LI>New York Department of Transportation.   
</UL>
Other Federal entities in various countries are evaluating the use of GeoTIFF format for public
distribution of their products, including the United Kingdom Military Survey.  
     
Further information on industry support is in the 
<A HREF="providers.html"> 
GeoTIFF Providers Table</A>     
<P></P>

<H3><A NAME="Does GeoTIFF imagery conform to the TIFF specification?">Does GeoTIFF imagery conform to the TIFF specification?</A></H3>
     
The TIFF spec (Version 6) is be supported by the GeoTIFF format. 
That is, the GeoTIFF images conform in every way to the 
TIFF formal specifications.  The tags used for the "Geo" portion of 
the TIFF format conform to the acceptable and customary
use of "private" or "registered" TIFF tagsets.  The GeoTIFF tags and definitions are 
considered completely "orthogonal" to the baseline and extended
TIFF tag definitions currently supported in TIFF V 6 by Adobe/Aldus.
 <P></P>    

<H3><A NAME="Can systems that don't use geography read a GeoTIFF image?">Can systems that don't use geography read a GeoTIFF image?</A></H3>
     
Many such image "visualization" systems do not use geography as a 
basis for placement of their images.  These systems are all able 
to view a GeoTIFF image just as though there were no geographic 
information in the TIFF file.  To non-GeoTIFF-savvy readers, the 
GeoTIFF image should look and behave like any other TIFF image. 
<P></P>

<!-- UPDATE: Frank Warmerdam-->

Note, that some systems that don't support the double precision tag
type of TIFF 6.0, or that fail with TIFF files with unexpected private
tags, cannot read GeoTIFF files.  It seems that ArcView 2 suffered 
from this problem.<p>

<H3><A NAME="Does the Geographic data look transparent to the user?">Does the Geographic data look transparent to the user?</A></H3>

Or does the user have to do something with the GeoTIFF 
to be able to load and place it ?
     <P></P>
This is a software implementation question.   But most GeoTIFF-savvy 
systems look at the geographic information 
and use it without any requirement that the user know the content 
of the geographic tags.  The GeoTIFF format provides enough 
information that the software can automatically place an image 
without requirement of any user intervention, such as typing
in coordinates, digitizing points, or other labor intensive 
and technical actions.   One aim of GeoTIFF is to reduce the 
need of users to be geographic experts in order to load a 
map-projected image or scanned map. 
<P></P>

The original working group included representatives of SPOT Image Corp, and 
SPOT Image S.A. (France), Jet Propulsion Laboratory (NASA), 
US Geological Survey, Intergraph, ESRI, ERDAS, Trifid, MapInfo, 
and Softdesk. In addition, a consortium of over 140 international 
subscribers have been monitoring and contributing to the spec's 
evolution through an email discussion forum.
In April, 1996, over 40 industry representatives, including several 
international participants, members of US DMA (Defence Mapping Agency),
and additional software companies (Bentley, E Systems, and others) and 
additional satellite and aerial imaging providers (Space Imaging, Orbital,
Vargis Aerial and others).  For a full list of participants in the

<H3><A NAME="What's a TIFF tag?">What's a TIFF tag?</A></H3>
     
A TIFF tag conveys information about the imagery.  It is TIFF's 
version of metadata (data about data).  TIFF Tags are the only
way that a TIFF reading software can obtain fundamental information 
about the TIFF image. TIFF reading softwares all implement TIFF tags 
to control the display and printing of TIFF images. 
<P></P>     
     
<H3><A NAME="What is the relationship between a TIFF tag and the actual image?">What is the relationship between a TIFF tag and the actual image?</A></H3>
     
The image is the "product" or the "purpose" of the TIFF format. 
The "tags" merely describe the image with information that the
TIFF reader needs to know in order to control the appearance of the 
image on the user's display screen or printer.
<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="Are the tags in separate files from the tiff files ...">
Are the tags in separate files from the tiff files ... </A></H3>

... or are they built into the tiff file format? 
<P></P>     
The TIFF tags are built into the TIFF format.   They include:
     
   <UL>
   <LI>TIFF Basic Tags (like tags for number of rows, columns, etc).  
These are standard and mandatory in all TIFF files.
        
   <LI>TIFF Extended Tags (like tags for certain color systems, rather
     more specialized).  These are optional in all TIFF files. 
       
   <LI>"Private" TIFF tags (like the GeoTIFF tags).  
	These include tags which are registered to 
     specific users, in blocks of five tags.  The users who register 
     their tags, may put any information they like on those tags
     to support their software community.  Then they can write 
     software to use those tags in whatever way they please. 
</UL>    
<P></P> 
<H3><A NAME="Why is GeoTIFF based only on TIFF format?">Why is GeoTIFF based only on TIFF format?</A></H3>

... instead of, say, GIF or BMP or LAN or IMG or other formats?
TIFF is already used for geographic imagery, using certain proprietary
tag structures.  GeoTIFF merely expands this to involve public domain
tags and structures that are interoperable between any GIS.
<P></P>   
TIFF is the only format in the public domain which can support 
the wide variety of image types already used for geographic 
imagery.  TIFF can support 8-bit black and white images, up 
to 16 and 32 bit elevation models, 24 bit color imagery, and any 
other type of image.  TIFF also supports the most varieties of 
compression and tiling options, to increase the efficiency of 
image transfer and utilization.  The other data formats possible 
are limited in these areas, or are still merely proposals, while 
TIFF has been implemented for a decade or so. 
     <P></P>
It is almost the only format which allows the flexibility
to support tag structures, like the geographic metadata
of GEOTIFF, without causing a conflict with non-geographic uses 
of the raster imagery.  TIFF is already the most popular image 
format in the world, and most GIS platforms can already handle TIFF format today, using 
either the TIFF Basic tagset, extended tagset, or various 
private tagsets.  
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Is the tagset proprietary?">Is the tagset proprietary?</A></H3>
The TIFF tags (remember, these are *metadata*) are not proprietary.
The GeoTIFF tags are 
completely public and published for anyone to use for any imagery. 
So, anyone may create any images which use the same tagset
as SPOT or other users of the GeoTIFF structure.  
<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="Is the SPOT data still proprietary?">Is the SPOT data still proprietary?</A></H3>
     
The actual *image* (if provided by SPOT) IS PROPRIETARY and subject to 
all licenses applicable to the purchase of the data.  This means
that you cannot copy and send around SPOTView images, just 
because they are in TIFF format!  This is against the law. 
    <P></P> 
Some providers may make some images free, others may require licensing
for sale.  The GeoTIFF format does not change whatever license conditions
are imposed by an image provider.  Format has no relationship to the license
conditions of ownership or sale. 
<P></P>
Put another way, the GeoTIFF tags, specification, and format are public.
But the imagery is not, unless specified as free by the provider.  
<P></P>

<H3><A NAME="What are the advantages of TIFF format for geographic data?">What are the advantages of TIFF format for geographic data?</A></H3>
     
The user of a GeoTIFF file, and a GeoTIFF-savvy software reader will notice
that the software will let the user load and place the image on a 
simplified "point and click" basis.  The users should not have to enter
projection strings, control points, cartographic definitions, etc in order
to support the loading of the image. 
<P></P>

<H3><A NAME="Is GeoTIFF really platform interoperable?">Is GeoTIFF really platform interoperable?</A></H3>

The TIFF structure is the only image format which is extensible, allows 
private implementations and has the flexibility to support geographic 
information.  For users, GeoTIFF files provide the possibility of 
a single image format compatible with all GIS vendor softwares.  
At present, many GIS softwares do implement the ability to read the
exact same GeoTIFF specification for any compliant image file.   This means
that users of different softwares can now exchange and share raster files
without needing to run translators, assuming they are exchanging between
softwares that read GeoTIFF format.  
     <P></P>
The TIFF tag structure is designed to be simple 
and platform independent, so any GIS software developer can make 
use of the tags in just a few hours of program development.  TIFF 
files which use the proposed GeoTIFF tagset can be transported from 
one display environment to another, provided both system softwares 
support the GeoTIFF spec.  For the user, this means greater ease of use of 
images, less hassle importing and exporting raster formats, and less 
duplication of images in everyone's proprietary format in a single
network of heterogeneous GIS displays. 
<P></P>

<H3><A NAME="What will happen in my GIS if I load a GeoTIFF image?">What will happen in my GIS if I load a GeoTIFF image?</A></H3>
     
When users "click on" a TIFF image in a GeoTIFF-savvy reader 
and it comes up on their screen the image should be automatically 
"georeferenced" to correct position and scale, with respect 
to the cartographic parameters of the users "map projection."  
Thus the GeoTIFF image should display "in the right position", 
compared to other features in the computer display (such as 
roads, hydrology, or similar mapped features). In this way, a satellite image 
of, say, San Francisco, will position itself in the GIS 
in San Francisco, and the roads, streams, and coastlines
in the GIS coverages will overlay on top of the image.  This is 
useful for any GIS applications where the user wants to see
both the digital map, and a picture of the same area in the same 
geometric reference.   From this a user can "heads-up" digitize, 
interpret features visible on the image, or conduct other 
raster/vector processes supported by the GIS. 
<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="Doesn't anyone else have TIFF tags for geographic information?">Doesn't anyone else have TIFF tags for geographic information?</A></H3>
     
Both ESRI and Intergraph have been involved in the GeoTIFF definition 
since the inception of GeoTIFF and have released softwares which support 
the open GeoTIFF tag structure. 
<P></P>
ESRI has a history of using a private tag which Arc/Info uses to 
support image placement.  
This tag is basically a simple tag implementation of their 
WORLD file on a TIFF tag, internal to the TIFF format file. 
ESRI prefers to keep this tag private.  GeoTIFF tags do 
everything ESRI's tag could do and a lot more. 
  <P></P>   
Intergraph also has a tag set which they have used for
several years to support their raster geographic 
softwares.  This set is completely private since they reserve 
the right to change any of its structure at any time without 
review or notification outside of their user base.  
There are many many other TIFF private 
tagsets, as well as private "IFD's" (image file directories) 
which can exist transparently within the TIFF structure.    
But only GeoTIFF is known to the public domain 
and supports geographic parameters. 
   <P></P>  
<H3><A NAME="Is GeoTIFF based on the world reference files that ESRI uses?">Is GeoTIFF based on the world reference files that ESRI uses?</A></H3>
     
ESRI's world file is a separate file with limited metadata content 
designed only for use in Arc/Info and other ESRI softwares. 
The GeoTIFF structure, by comparison, is rich in content and 
packs everything into a single file.   The GeoTIFF tag stucture 
covers more diverse options for projection spaces, datums, 
ellipsoids, coordinate types, and related geographic features 
than the ESRI tag.  And the GeoTIFF structure is intended to 
become entirely public domain, unlike tags withheld for 
private implementations.  (ESRI reports they are reworking their
image display software to make more robust use of GeoTIFF and 
TIFF V 6.0 capabilities in future releases of their softwares.)
<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="What are the requirements to make a TIFF image ...">What are the requirements to make a TIFF image ...</A></H3>

... which is geographically correct for the proposed tagset?
<P></P>     
The images should be pre-corrected to a standard map projection, 
such as UTM, StatePlane, an international grid coordinate system
(such as "British NationalGrid", or "Nigeria East Belt" or similar).   
Geotiff-savvy TIFF readers can then use the geotie tags 
to place the image (say a satellite image) into the correct 
position in the GIS display.  For SPOT's products (called our SPOTView 
product line) the images will be accurate within 12 meters
horizontal anywhere in the USA (a looser spec prevails in most 
international SPOTViews).  Images which are not georeferenced 
to a map projection can still be entered into a GeoTIFF format 
but with some compromises on precision/accuracy of placement. 
<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="Can I make customized geographic projections using GeoTIFF?">Can I make customized geographic projections using GeoTIFF?</A></H3>
     
The GeoTIFF spec contains fields for definition of projection 
variables in 20 different coordinate transformation systems 
(such as Lambert Conformal Conic, Albers Equal Area, 
Transverse Mercator, etc).  The datums and ellipsoids 
supported by POSC are all available, as well as limited 
support for most custom datums and ellipsoids.  The GeoTIFF
format provides rules, fields, and "cookbooks" for defining 
customized cartographic spaces if you need them.  Since they will be
coded as "User Defined" in some fields, not all GeoTIFF readers will 
be able to understand all possibilities.

... and platform interoperable raster imagery? 
<P></P>    
TELL your GIS software provider that you need to read 
raster imagery which is in GeoTIFF format.  Log formal 
change requests with your software vendor, especially if 
they are not on the current list of GeoTIFF supporters.  
Most software companies develop on the basis of logged 
formal client change requests.  If nobody puts in a change 
request, then the software doesn't get developed.  You will 
be doing yourself, your GIS provider, and your fellow users
a service by making this issue visible to the GIS providers. 
<P></P>
You can also participate in a variety of standardization activities
throughout the geographic information processing industry and government.  
GeoTIFF has been proposed to the Open GIS Consortium, for example, and other
entities are evaluating whether GeoTIFF should be proposed to international
or other standards groups.  Let your opinion be known.  "Wreak yourself
upon the world" (Robert Bork).

<h3><a name="Status">Is the GeoTIFF community still active?</h3>

GeoTIFF standard improvement efforts have been quiet since about early
1997.  In early 1998 the original GeoTIFF mailing list stopped working due
to a machine failure at JPL, and a new list wasn't started till the fall
of 1998.   Dr. Niles Ritter has left JPL, and while still hosting the
GeoTIFF web pages, isn't active in GeoTIFF efforts as part of his job any
more.  Mike Ruth has recently left Spot, and is less active in GeoTIFF 
efforts.<p>

However, in the meantime most geographically aware software produced that
could utilize TIFF imagery has added some level of support for GeoTIFF 
ingest, and/or production.  Discussions on mailing lists and between software
vendors has resulted in some refinements to interpretations of some 
GeoTIFF tags.<p>

In a sense GeoTIFF has become a large success despite a light hand at the 
helm.<p>

However, the quality of GeoTIFF implementations varies greatly, there are
no means to do conformance testing on produced GeoTIFF files.  Attempts
to flesh out parameter lists for complex projections, and to clarify issues
of unit types and other problems has fallen by the wayside.  EPSG has
released many improvements to the underlying projection and datum
tables, but it isn't clear whether these apply to GeoTIFF.  Hopes of a
GeoTIFF 2.0 specification have not been realized.<p>

It is my (Frank Warmerdam) hope to reawaken the GeoTIFF community enough
to at least provide a forum for discussion, and publicise evolving 
practice with regard to GeoTIFF.<p>
