<h3>Notes</h3>

The GeoTIFF geo_ctrans.inc file shows that CT_SwissObliqueCylindrical is
an alias for CT_ObliqueMercator_Rosenmund, but the EPSG database says that
it is accomodated by the Oblique Mercator method (9815).  I am not sure
what to make of all this.  CT_ObliqueMercator_Rosenmund does not seem
to be a supported method in EPSG.<p>

If this is mapped onto Hotine Oblique Mercator, it isn't obvious to me
what the settings for Azimuth, Angle from rectified grid, and scale at 
center should be ... likely 90, 90 and 1.0.<p>

<h3>EPSG Notes</h3>

Can be accomodated by Oblique Mercator method (code 9815).<p>
