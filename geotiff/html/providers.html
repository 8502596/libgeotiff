 <h1>GeoTIFF Data Providers</h1><p>
<p>
<ul>
The following organizations are now or will soon be providing
GeoTIFF-compatible raster data products:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The
 <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/">
USGS</a> is now producing prototypes of their 
<a href="http://mapping.usgs.gov/mac/isb/pubs/factsheets/fs12295.html">
Digital Raster Graphic
(DRG)</a> format data; previous versions were supplied only with a 
 Federal Geographic Data Committee compliant Metadata file, and
 a ".TFW" TIFF world-file,
 but the latest release have established GeoTIFF as the 
 standard georeferencing method on the CD-ROM. The USGS currently maintains an
 <a href="ftp://ftpmcmc.cr.usgs.gov/release/geotiff/">
FTP Archive</a> of GeoTIFF test data, including DRG prototypes.
<p>
<li>
 <a href="http://www.inlink.com/~trifid/index.html">
Trifid</a> will be implementing GeoTIFF by mid-December ('95) on all of its
commercial data products.
<p>
<li>
<b>GeoSpectrum</b> plans to use GeoTIFF tags to reference radio propagation
raster sets.  Contact
<a href="mailto:gsi@MT.net">Dan Hawkins</a> for more info.

<li>
 <a href="http://www.imagelinks.com">ImageLinks </a>

company specializing in high  volume, low cost geocoding, mosaicking,
tonal balancing and data fusion  plus many other processing services of

production when they fly towards the end of 1997. The data formats will include
GeoTIFF.

<a href="http://www.spot.com/">
SPOT</a> intends to start shipping the SPOTView product line
