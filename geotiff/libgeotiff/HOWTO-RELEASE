	Preparing a libgeotiff Release
	==============================


 1) Update the VERSION_MAJOR/MINOR/POINT information in configure.in.

 2) Add a note to the ChangeLog that a new release is being issued, and what
    the release number is.

 3) Tag the release with a command like "cvs tag libgeotiff_1_1_4" from the
    libgeotiff directory.
