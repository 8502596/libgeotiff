	Preparing a libgeotiff Release
	==============================

 1) Update the VERSION_MAJOR/MINOR/POINT information in configure.in.

 2) Add a note to the ChangeLog that a new release is being issued, and what
    the release number is.

 3) Tag the release with a command like "cvs tag libgeotiff_1_1_4" from the
    libgeotiff directory.

 4) Prepare a zip and tar.gz file using a command like "mkdist.sh 1.1.5" 
    from within the geotiff/libgeotiff directory. 

 5) Test build and install on at least one Unix platform.  Test build on a
    Windows system.

 6) The resulting files (eg. libgeotiff-1.1.5.tar.gz and libgeotiff115.zip) 
    should be copied to the distribution directory (geotiff/libgeotiff on 
    ftp.remotesensing.org).

 7) If possible build windows, and linux binaries of listgeo, and geotifcp
    for distribution.  Binary distributions should include the csv files,
    and the geotifcp.html and listgeo.html files from geotiff-ht.
